## Project Overview

This repository contains the business case for analyzing customer spending behavior at Walmart using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The project aims to provide insights into spending patterns across different demographics and recommend actionable strategies for business improvements.

## Business Case Summary

The business case for Walmart's Customer Spending Analysis evaluates the spending patterns of different customer segments (gender, marital status, and age groups) and provides strategic recommendations based on statistical analysis and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). This initiative aims to enhance Walmart's understanding of customer behavior and improve business strategies accordingly.

## Objectives

- **Analyze Spending Patterns**: Examine spending behavior across various customer segments.
- **Leverage CLT**: Utilize the Central Limit Theorem to understand the distribution of average spending.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations to improve customer engagement and sales.

## Scope

- Statistical analysis of spending data segmented by gender, marital status, and age groups.
- Calculation of confidence intervals to understand the distribution of average spending.
- Recommendations based on the insights derived from the analysis.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data on customer transactions.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Performed statistical analysis using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and calculated confidence intervals.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Tested hypotheses regarding spending differences among various segments.
4. **Visualization**: Created visualizations to illustrate spending patterns and confidence intervals.
5. **Strategic Recommendations**: Developed recommendations based on the analysis.

## Key Findings

### 1. Gender-Based Spending
- **Are Women Spending More?**: Women are spending less money per transaction than men based on the p-value of 0.0014.
- **Confidence Intervals**:
  - Male: 90% CI: (9173.29, 9701.65), 95% CI: (9126.54, 9748.93), 99% CI: (9022.05, 9852.38)
  - Female: 90% CI: (8489.73, 8983.83), 95% CI: (8445.06, 9032.13), 99% CI: (8344.53, 9120.23)
- **Overlap**: The confidence intervals for male and female spending overlap slightly, indicating potential similarities in average spending but with a notable difference.

### 2. Marital Status-Based Spending
- **Spending Differences**: There are differences in spending between married and unmarried customers.
- **Confidence Intervals**:
  - Married: 90% CI: (8991.61, 9525.44), 95% CI: (8944.14, 9573.46), 99% CI: (8836.34, 9669.62)
  - Unmarried: 90% CI: (9001.62, 9527.77), 95% CI: (8956.03, 9581.98), 99% CI: (8863.35, 9661.29)
- **Overlap**: The confidence intervals for married and unmarried customers also overlap, suggesting similar spending patterns.

### 3. Age Group-Based Spending
- **Spending Patterns**: Different age groups show varying spending patterns.
- **Confidence Intervals**:
  - 0-17: 90% CI: (8673.79, 9204.05), 95% CI: (8621.11, 9256.18), 99% CI: (8525.99, 9370.51)
  - 18-25: 90% CI: (8902.66, 9424.63), 95% CI: (8853.23, 9484.42), 99% CI: (8762.27, 9590.33)
  - 26-35: 90% CI: (8991.76, 9506.49), 95% CI: (8945.69, 9561.80), 99% CI: (8849.74, 9653.17)
  - 36-45: 90% CI: (9073.87, 9599.55), 95% CI: (9018.64, 9649.60), 99% CI: (8930.90, 9737.95)
  - 46-50: 90% CI: (8949.74, 9471.00), 95% CI: (8901.23, 9520.21), 99% CI: (8814.17, 9612.45)
  - 51-55: 90% CI: (9267.57, 9801.56), 95% CI: (9217.52, 9849.17), 99% CI: (9117.91, 9947.73)
  - 55+: 90% CI: (9079.40, 9595.58), 95% CI: (9031.07, 9646.50), 99% CI: (8945.69, 9746.51)
- **Overlap**: There is some overlap between age groups, but significant differences exist, particularly for the 51-55 age group, which tends to spend more.

## Recommendations

### Gender-Based Spending
- **Targeted Promotions**: Develop targeted promotions for female customers to encourage higher spending.
- **Personalized Offers**: Use personalized offers to cater to the preferences of female customers.

### Marital Status-Based Spending
- **Couples Discounts**: Introduce discounts for couples and family bundles to attract married customers.
- **Single-Friendly Offers**: Create offers that cater specifically to single customers.

- **Age-Specific Campaigns**: Develop marketing campaigns targeting specific age groups, particularly the high-spending 51-55 age group.
- **Loyalty Programs**: Enhance loyalty programs to include age-specific rewards and benefits.

## Final Insights

- **Distribution and Relationships**: The distribution of spending varies across gender, marital status, and age groups. The relationships between these variables can inform targeted marketing strategies.
- **Univariate and Bivariate Analysis**: Each segment's spending behavior provides insights that can be generalized to the population, highlighting the importance of personalized marketing.
- **Generalization for Population**: The findings can be used to generalize spending patterns for the broader customer base, informing business strategies.
